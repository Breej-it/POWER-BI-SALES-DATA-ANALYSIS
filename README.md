# POWER BI
This project showcases my proficiency in leveraging Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful insights. By combining various visualizations such as revenue by city, product segment, and sales performance by store managers and representatives, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the superstore’s operational efficiency. The analysis is further enhanced by a detailed profit breakdown by product category, enabling stakeholders to pinpoint the most profitable product lines. Additionally, the top 5 product chart highlights key revenue drivers, helping the business focus on its best-performing items.

A key feature of the report is the customer performance table, which offers a granular view of each customer’s impact on the business. By including profit, revenue, and percentage contribution metrics, the table enables decision-makers to identify high-value customers and strategically plan for customer retention or targeted sales efforts. This project illustrates my ability to not only present data in a visually engaging manner but also to extract actionable insights that can drive business growth.
